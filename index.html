At a certain point in my childhood drawings, shoelaces began to appear more prominently. The laces are drawn turning at each eyelet, looped and tied with excesses of string emerging from the knot, represented by a saturated rubbing. When I was learning to tie my first knots, shoelaces became a site of personal complexity. My movement throughout the world depended on a precise hand-tying of these laces.
</p><p>
"Our ships are a mass of knots." Once upon a time, these held great power—they were the knots that held together the grand, exploitative project of European colonialism—a project I re-enacted in sailing class, ages eight through ten. The sea became navigable to me after a ritual of lacing and tying. In the eulogy of Joseph Marie Jacquard, it is stated that Napoleon once screamed in the presence of the inventor, "Are you the man, sir, who can do what God Almighty cannot, tie a knot in a stretched string?"
</p><p>
By the 20th century, these ships—by now having shed many of their ropes for cables—were used to connect continents with underwater cords. These cords were kept out of sight, and Colonialism was retitled to Connectivity. In Connectivity, strings and cables are hidden; heraldry is abandoned for secrecy.
</p><p>
When IBM transformed Jacquard’s loom into the computer, they replaced the threads. But navigation, communication, and power are still mediated by a series of strings—at least 6 characters long, a combination of upper- and lower-case letters, digits, and non-alphanumeric characters.
</p><p>
In the grand regatta of online, what were once the complex thoughts and behaviors that composed identity become discrete, traceable, searchable, and marketed to. But we need to feel complex and untraceable in order to feel independent and free. Now, the complexity of the self is implied by the blurring of meeting strings: a collection of memorized passwords. The freedom to navigate an underwater network of cables is reliant on the privacy of these handmade strings.
</p><p>
The ritualistic practices of encryption and decryption—tying and untying—remain intimately bound to the user’s relationship with the practice of information security. In encryption, the most unique and illegible strings create the most secure knots. Out of this practice evolves a new vernacular language—one that is hand-typed and confidential, unpredictable and incomputable, enigmatic, and therefore vitally human.
